/*
	Animation2D is a Seoul Engine implementation of
	a Spine runtime: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes

	The Animation2D code is available under a separate repo: https://github.com/demiurgestudios/seoulengine-animation2D

	Please note that portions of the Animation2D code are based
	on the stock Spine C runtime and are therefore subject to the license
	terms of the Spine Runtime license: https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/blob/master/spine-c/LICENSE

	To enable Animation2D support, extract the Animation2D repository into
	the SeoulEngine\Code\Animation2D folder, and then set SEOUL_WITH_ANIMATION_2D to 1
	in BuildFeatures.h

	Once enabled, Animation2D must be paired with v3.8.79 of the Spine editor
	to generate compatible JSON animation data.
