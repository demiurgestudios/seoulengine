INSTRUCTIONS

Commands will automatically update the next time you run a Developer
PC build of AppPC. If this fails, or if you would like to update
these commands manually, follow the steps below.

To Add Commands to Adobe Animate:
  1. First close Adobe Animate.
  2. "Custom Commands" need to live in a particular place. Open Windows Explorer and paste:
      %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Adobe\Animate CC 2019\en_US\Configuration\Commands

      (AppData\Local\Adobe\Animate CC 2019\en_US\Configuration\Commands)
  3. Copy in each JSFL files as desired
  4. Launch Animate

To Run Commands:
  "Actually Update Image(s)" Command:
    1. Select one or more images in your Flash Library with a absolute path.
    2. Then click within the File Bar: Commands -> Actually Update Images.
    3. A prompt will appear, "One of more library items already exist in the document"
    4. Select "Replace exisiting items" and hit OK.

  "Delete Unused" Command:
    1. Click within the File Bar: Commands -> Delete Unused.
    2. All items and folders will be removed

  "Find Library Item Path" Command:
    1. Select a single item in your library
    2. Then click within the File Bar: Commands -> Find Library Item Path.
    3. Two path lists will appear. One which shows the layers to navigate through,
       and the other which shows the instance names of the movie clips

  "Fix ActionScript" Command:
    1. Click within the File Bar: Commands -> Fix ActionScript.
    2. Generate .as stubs for any classes missing one. This command
       is also run when the "Fix Sharing" Command is run.

  "Fix Sharing" Command:
    1. Click within the File Bar: Commands -> Fix Sharing.
    2. Attempts to resolve a common error where a Movie Clip exported for AS/RS
       has been copied instead of imported

  "Update Shared" Command:
    1. Click within the File Bar: Commands -> Update Shared
    2. A robust version of "Authortime Sharing" update, attempts to refresh all
       shared assets in Adobe Animate (vs. at runtime). Likely to fail if the
       file being updated has duplicate assets.
